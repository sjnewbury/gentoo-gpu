gentoo-gpu
=============

This repository contains mostly live or current ebuilds
for bleeding-edge support of GPU APIs: OpenCL, GPU
offloading, Vulkan, video acceleration etc.

For up-to-date ROCm support use in conjunction with
my rocm-bleeding-edge repository.

NEWS
GCC Offload Accelerators are now working, at least
I've tested it with AMD ROCm with gfx900 (Vega64) and
GCC-12.2.1 + ROCm-5.4.2.
